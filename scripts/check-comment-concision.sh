# Advisory nudge, never a hard failure (dotfiles#375/ADR-0006): flags a
# comment block that's an outlier length for a single declaration, as a
# prompt to re-read it for content already covered elsewhere
# (design-principles.md's pointer rule) — it doesn't try to detect
# redundancy itself. THRESHOLD_LINES is calibrated against this repo's own
# real blocks, not a guess: the densest legitimate single-declaration
# comment found here is app.tf's 10-line github_actions_secret block, so
# the threshold sits with headroom above it to avoid crying wolf on this
# repo's normal (dense but non-redundant) style. Mirrors dotfiles'
# reference implementation (ADR-0031 there) rather than re-deriving the
# design — see this repo's ADR-0006 for what's identical and what's
# recalibrated.
